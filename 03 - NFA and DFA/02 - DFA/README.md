## ALGO

### For strings starting with "aa" or "bb"

1. Declare a character array str to store the input string.

2. Prompt the user to enter a string.

3. Check the first two characters of the input string (str[0] and str[1]):
    - If str[0] is 'a' and str[1] is 'a':
        - Print "String accepted."
    - Else if str[0] is 'b' and str[1] is 'b':
        - Print "String accepted."
    - Else:
        - Print "String rejected."

4. Display the result based on the DFA transition.
